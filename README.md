# Python-WebScraper
This program takes a csv file, and scrapes eBay for listings of the products listed in the csv. It then outputs the data to another csv that has the name of that specfic product,
and contains every listing's name, link, and price.
<h1>Input Format</h1>
In the med.csv file, parse the inputs to the webscraper by inputting sku, name. The script takes this and then creates the output csvs from it.
